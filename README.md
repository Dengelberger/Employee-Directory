  ## Installation 
  
  To build a react app I first had to use npm create-react-app and name the app. Then I had to clean out unnecessary files and build my app.  Finally, this app was deployed using GitHub deploy.


  ## Usage 
  
  This program can be used by anyone who wants to keep a contact list somewhere and be able to search for people in their list of contacts.

  ## Contributing 
  
  Thanks to the instructors and fellow classmates for help in completing this application. I used the main characters from the TV show M*A*S*H because it is one of my favorites. Here are some screenshots of the deployed app.

  This is the initial page upon deployment:

  This is what the page looks like as a search is started. This one was just the letter P:
